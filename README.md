## Customization with customer logos on home screen

You can customize the home screen with customer logos which will appear when the user hovers over any configured use-case tile.

To add customer logos to the home screen (`index.html`), add a `div` of class `customer-logos` to each tile you wish to customize and apply the class `customer-logo` to each image, as follows:

```html
</a>
<!-- You can add customer logos here.  See ReadMe for more info -->
<div class="customer-logos-bottom text-label">
  <img src="https://www.pubnub.com/pubnub_logo.svg" class="customer-logo">
  <img src="https://www.pubnub.com/pubnub_logo.svg" class="customer-logo"> <!--  optional -->
  <img src="https://www.pubnub.com/pubnub_logo.svg" class="customer-logo"> <!--  optional -->
</div>
<!--  End of added code for logos -->
