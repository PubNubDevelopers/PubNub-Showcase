## Usage Notes

### Firefox Users

Firefox will not allow you to share storage between pages.  This is a [feature and not a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1730419).  Please load the demo from a local server to use with Firefox, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8001`.  Be sure to use `localhost` rather than the IP address when doing this, for full compatibility with the IoT demo.  *These are only issues running locally, you will not experience issues running a hosted version of this app*

## Customization to change colors and demo content

- To modify the application theme, modify the colors located at the top of `/shared/style.css`.  Named colors are used throughout this application so changing them here will update the entire app.

- To modify the video displayed in the Live Events app, update the file `/live-events/live-events.html`, search for the `iframe` tag and modify the YouTube video ID.  This application has not been tested with any video service other than YouTube.

- To modify the groups shown in the Chat app, update the file `/chat/chat-constants.js`.  Only the public groups should be modified, not the private group.  Group names can contain any character A to Z, a to z, 0 to 9 or '-'.

- The poll questions given in the Live Events app can be modified by changing the file `/live-events/poll-questions.js`.

## Customization with customer logos on home screen

You can customize the home screen with customer logos which will appear when the user hovers over any configured use-case tile.

To add customer logos to the home screen (`index.html`), add a `div` of class `customer-logos` to each tile you wish to customize and apply the class `customer-logo` to each image, as follows:

```html
</a>
<!-- You can add customer logos here.  See ReadMe for more info -->
<div class="customer-logos-bottom text-label">
  <img src="https://www.pubnub.com/pubnub_logo.svg" class="customer-logo">
  <img src="https://www.pubnub.com/pubnub_logo.svg" class="customer-logo"> <!--  optional -->
  <img src="https://www.pubnub.com/pubnub_logo.svg" class="customer-logo"> <!--  optional -->
</div>
<!--  End of added code for logos -->
```
