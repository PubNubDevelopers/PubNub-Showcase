/**
 * Polls are a great way to add interactivity to a live or live event and PubNub can provide
 * the underlying communication infrastructure to power your live poll, both questions and
 * responses.
 * IN PRODUCTION:
 * To keep things private and fair, you will want to use a combination of access manager and
 * server-side logic to ensure clients only have access to the questions and not any other clients'
 * response (until and when the response is revealed to the entire audience).  This demo
 * keeps everything local, to keep things transparent and simple.
 * The first step is to broadcast the details of the poll (i.e. the questions and any meta data).
 * Typically this would be on a 'polls.px' channel, where x represents the poll number since your
 * app could have multiple polls.  (This step is omitted in this demo, questions are stored in
 * poll-questions.js) and the poll can be submitted at any time.
 * Votes from each client then need to be submitted, this can be done in a number of ways but you need
 * to convey the following information back to the server: Which poll the answer is for, which question
 * is being answered and which answer is being given.  This demo uses the 'votes.p1' channel since there
 * is only a single poll, then the question and answer are given provided as message data (see the publish() call)
 * Additional server logic: You will need some logic (flag) on your server to ensure each client can only
 * vote once, as well as allow the user to change their choice, if you want to allow that.  This demo
 * largely skips over these checks to make things more interactive.
 * Results: Once the poll closes, you will want to submit the results to all listening clients on a separate
 * channel, results.px, where x represents the poll number.
 * To learn about questions and provide responses, clients need read access to polls.* and results.*.
